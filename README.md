# Retinal_Vessel_Segmentation_Project
This project is for paper "Retinal Vessel based on Unet_FPN" by Xinyuan Zuo

### Both CHASE AND DRIVE test predicted image is stored in predicted_img dir
### Trained model is stored in model_trained_{DATASET} dir

### Step1 Run resize_save_data.py to generate new big img

### Step2 Run data_slice.py to generate sliced images for trainning

### Step3 Run train.py to train

### Note: Every step import config_CHASE.py or config_DRIVE.py to select datasets
